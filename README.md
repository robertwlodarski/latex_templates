# LaTeX templates

This repository contains LaTeX packages I use in my work. 

1. `_slides`: This folder contains my slide templates, last updated in August 2025.
2. `settings.json`: This is the .json file I use with VSCode.
   - In the past, VSCode better supported creating subfolders for auxiliary LaTeX files, but this now leads to several bags.
